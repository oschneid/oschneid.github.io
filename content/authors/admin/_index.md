Oliver Schneider leads the Haptic Computing Lab as an Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo, Department of Management Science and Engineering, with cross-appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, and the Cheriton School of Computer Science.

His work focuses on what he calls Haptic Experience (HX) Research. His team studies the design, study, and evaluation of complete haptic systems, with a drive towards studying these systems in-depth and at scale. As part of this work, his team builds software and conceptual tools for HX design and research to enable anyone, anywhere to be able to work with haptic technology just like it's other media.
